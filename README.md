# music-noise-segmentation-on-a-spectrogram

- Goal : An effective way to classify and analyze audio signal with deep neural networks.

- The whole project is based on the Keras(Theano)

- Python dependencies : matplotlib, scipy, numpy, pylab, librosa, pickle, scikits, keras, skimage

- Must downloads : The learned weight of neural networks; Save this file into "pickel_folder"

- This technique is investigated for the purpose of making a preprocessing system for music information retrieval (MIR) techniques.

Note : As you can see in the above picture, the proposed convolutional neural networks successfully segments a spectrogram as their identity.
